* clean, functional code that is split into multiple files as needed
* implement lighting if possible and varied ASCII characters
* handle rendering background layer and foreground layer seperately
* add a GUI that adds an additional HUD layer on top of the game
* rendered raw without any graphics libraries, not even termbox or curses for small source binary
* rendering logic should be abstracted from world logic which is abstracted from game logic
* should i add a weight factor to this game?
    * then make weight reduce speed where speed is relative so each time you pick up or drop an item the item is a physical object that spawns in
    * also if you move slower then enemy speed just increases so they clear more tiles in a given turn (eg. increase speed 1 to 2 so every time u move one cell they move two)
* do i want to add multiple rooms like tikrit?
    * where each time you clear a room you have to choose a new buff for the enemy instead of a buff for yourself
    * highscore system where it saves to a local json
    * unique deathscreen
* allow for size of arena to be dynamically changed and a fixed formula to be used to calculate the resulting number of torches and subsequent dithering 
* add unit tests and update makefile accordingly
